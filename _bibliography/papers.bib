      abstract={In this paper, we explore how to utilize pre-trained language model to perform few-shot text classification where only a few annotated examples are given for each class. Since using traditional cross-entropy loss to fine-tune language model under this scenario causes serious overfitting and leads to sub-optimal generalization of model, we adopt supervised contrastive learning on few labeled data and consistency-regularization on vast unlabeled data. Moreover, we propose a novel contrastive consistency to further boost model performance and refine sentence representation. After conducting extensive experiments on four datasets, we demonstrate that our model (FTCC) can outperform state-of-the-art methods and has better robustness.}

      abstract={Recommending high-quality citations for research papers is challenging. Graph information can be beneficial to predict what papers one should cite for a research paper, given the paper title, abstract, contents, venue to submit, and authors. However, existing approaches heavily depend on text information via pre-trained language models (PLMs) from the content and neglect the impact of famous papers and authors. The main disadvantage of text-based approaches is the vulnerability to distribution shift when a new trend appears. Also, simply utilizing text signals from language models cannot characterize graph structures due to their sequence architecture. Thus we would be discussing and exploring the idea of joint modeling graph and text to facilitate mutual enhancement in text-rich networks for citation prediction based on multiple types of relationships and entities.}

      abstract={Recommender system suffers from huge selection bias from users, which makes utilizing causal inference to solve this problem becomes a necessary problem. However, traditional rating model only utilizing biased dataset and unbiased estimator cannot remarkably be improved. Thus, we fused the unbiased dataset into training model and combine it with jointly learning method to better improve the original baselines. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed doubly robust joint leaning method after fusing unbiased, missing rating data can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods and can dramatically reduce the error from rating model with the increasing number of unbiased data..}
